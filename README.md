## Features
* Scan QR codes for web links
* View QR code content
* If the content is a web link, you have the option of opening it
* If not, you can still view the text content

## Motivations
* I only scan QR codes for web links, nothing else
* Most QR code scanners in the store request for unnecessary
permissions
* Most QR code scanners in the store contain ads
