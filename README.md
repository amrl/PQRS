# PQRS
A **P**ainless **QR** **S**canner.

Only for web links.

Scan, view, open. Nothing else.

## Features
* Scan QR codes for web links
* View QR code content
* If it is a web link, you have the option of opening it
* If not, you can still view the text content embedded

## Motivations
* I only scan QR codes for web links, nothing else
* Most QR code scanners in the store request for unnecessary
permissions (more than just the camera)
* Most QR code scanners in the store contain ads
