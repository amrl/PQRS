## Features
* Scan QR codes for web links
* View QR code content
* If it is a web link, you have the option to open it
* If not, you can still view the text content embedded
* Dark colour scheme

## Motivations
* I only scan QR codes for web links, nothing else
* I want a quick and easy way to scan with no frills
* Most QR code scanners in the store request for unnecessary
permissions (more than just the camera)
* Most QR code scanners in the store contain ads
